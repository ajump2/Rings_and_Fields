Deﬁnition Ideal
A subring $A$ of a ring $R$ is called a (two-sided) ideal of $R$ if for
every $r \in R$ and every $a \in A$ both $ra$ and $ar$ are in $A$.

Theorem 14.1 IdeaI Test

A nonempty subset $A$ of a ring $R$ is an ideal of $R$ if

1. $a - b \in A$ whenever $a, b \in A$.
2. $ra$ and $ar$ are in $A$ whenever $a \in A$ and $r \in R$.

EXAMPLE 1 For any ring $R$, $\{0\}$ and $R$ are ideals of $R$. The ideal $\{0\}$ is
called the \textit{trivial} ideal.

EXAMPLE 2 For any positive integer $n$, the set $nZ = \{0, \pm n, \pm n, . . .}$ is an ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$.

EXAMPLE 3 Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity and let $a \in R$. The
set $\langle a\rangle = \{ra \vert r \in R\}$ is an ideal of $R$ called the principal ideal generated by $a$. (Notice that $\langle a \rangle$ is also the notation we used for the cyclic
subgroup generated by $a$. However, the intended meaning will always be
clear from the context.) The assumption that $R$ is commutative is necessary in this example.

EXAMPLE 4 Let $\mathbb{R}[x]$ denote the set of all polynomials with real coefﬁcients and let $A$ denote the subset of all polynomials with constant term
0. Then $A$ is an ideal of $\mathbb{R}[x]$ and $A = \langle x\rangle$.

EXAMPLE 5 Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity and let $a_1,a_2, \dots, a_n$ belong to $R$. Then $I = \langle a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) = \{r_1a_1 + r_2a_2 +
\cdots + r_na_n | r_i \in R}$ is an ideal of $R$ called the ideal generated by $a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n$. The veriﬁcation that I is an ideal is left as an easy exercise

(Exercise 3). I

EXAMPLE 6 Let $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ denote the ring of all polynomials with integer
coefﬁcients and let I be the subset of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of all polynomials with even
constant terms. Then $I$ is an ideal of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $I = \langle x, 2\rangle$ (see
Exercise 39).

EXAMPLE 7 Let $R$ be the ring of all real valued functions of a real
variable. The subset $S$ of all differentiable functions is a subring of $R$ but
not an ideal of $R$.

Theorem 14.2 Existence of Factor Rings

Let $R$ be a ring and let $A$ be a subring of $R$. The set of cosets $\{r + A \vert
r \in R\}$ is a ring under the operations $(s + A) + (t + A) = s + t + A$
and $(s + A)(t + A) = st + A$ if and only if $A$ is an ideal of $R$.

Deﬁnition Prime Ideal, Maximal Ideal

A prime ideal $A$ of a commutative ring $R$ is a proper ideal of $R$ such that
$a, b \in R$ and $ab \in A$ imply $a \in A$ or $b \in A$. A maximal ideal of a commutative ring $R$ is a proper ideal of $R$ such that, whenever $B$ is an ideal
of $R$ and $A \subseteq B \subseteq R$,then $B =A$ or $B =R$.

EXAMPLE 13 Let $n$ be an integer greater than 1. Then, in the ring of
integers, the ideal $n\mathbb{Z}$ is prime if and only if $n$ is prime (Exercise 9). ($\{0\}$
is also a prime ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$.)

EXAMPLE 14 The lattice of ideals of $\mathbb{Z}_{36}$ (Figure 14.1) shows that only
$\langle 2\rangle$ and $\langle 3\rangle$ are maximal ideals.

EXAMPLE 15 The ideal $\langle x^2 + 1\rangle$ is maximal in $\mathbb{R}[x]$. To see this, assume
that $A$ is an ideal of $\mathbb{R}[x]$ that properly contains $\langle x^2 + 1\rangle$. We will prove
that $A = \mathbb{R}[x]$ by showing that A contains some nonzero real number $c$.
[This is the constant polynomial $h(x) = c$ for all $x$.] Then $1 = (1/c)$ $c \in A$
and therefore, by Exercise 15, $A = \mathbb{R}[x]$. To this end, let $f(x) \in A$, but $f(x)
\not \in \langle x^2 + 1\rangle$. Then

$$f(x) = q(x)(x^2 + 1) + r(x),$$

Where $r(x) \not = 0$ and the degree of $r(x)$ is less than 2. It follows that
$r(x) = ax + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are not both 0, and

$$ax + b = r(x) =f(x) - q(x)(x^2 + 1) \in A.$$

EXAMPLE 16 The ideal $\langle x^2 + 1\rangle is not prime in $\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$, since it contains
$(x+1)^2=x^2+2x+1=x^2+1$ but does not contain $x+1$.

I Theorem 14.3 R/A Is an Integral Domain If and Only IfA Is Prime

Let R be a commutative ring with unity and let A be an ideal of R.
Then R/A is an integral domain if and only if A is prime.

I Theorem 14.4 R/A Is a Field If and Only lfA ls Maximal

Let R be a commutative ring with unity and let A be an ideal of R.
Then R/A is a field if and only if A is maximal.

I EXAMPLE 17 The ideal (x) is a prime ideal in Z[x] but not a maximal
ideal in Z[x]. To verify this, we begin with the observation that (x) =
{f(x) E Z[x] | f(0) = 0} (see Exercise 31). Thus, if g(x)h(x) E (x), then
g(0)h(0) = 0. And since g(0) and h(0) are integers, we have g(0) = 0 or
h(0) = 0.

To see that (x) is not maximal, we simply note that (x) C (x, 2) C
Z[x] (see Exercise 39). I
