\begin{definition}{Irreducible Polynomial, Reducible Polynomial}

Let $D$ be an integral domain. A polynomial $f(x)$ from $D[x]$ that is
neither the zero polynomial nor a unit in $D[x]$ is said to be irreducible
over $D$ if, whenever $f(x)$ is expressed as a product $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, with
$g(x)$ and $h(x)$ from $D[x]$, then $g(x)$ or $h(x)$ is a unit in $D[x]$. A nonzero,
nonunit element of $D[x]$ that is not irreducible over $D$ is called
reducible over $D$.
\end{definition}

\textbf{EXAMPLE} 1 The polynomial $f(x) = 2x^2 + 4$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$
but reducible over $\mathbb{Z}$, since $2x^2 + 4 = 2(x^2 + 2)$ and neither $2$ nor $x^2 + 2$
is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.

\textbf{EXAMPLE} 2 The polynomial $f(x) = 2x^2 + 4$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{R}$
but reducible over $\mathbb{C}$.

\textbf{EXAMPLE} 3 The polynomial $x^2 - 2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ but reducible
over $\mathbb{R}$.

\textbf{EXAMPLE} 4 The polynomial $x^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_3$ but reducible
over $\mathbb{Z}_5$.

\begin{theorem}{Reducibility Test for Degrees 2 and 3}

Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field. If $f(x) \in \mathbb{F}[x]$ and deg f(x) is 2 or 3, then f(x) is
reducible over $\mathbb{F}$ if and only if $f(x)$ has a zero in $\mathbb{F}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}{Content at a Polynomial, Primitive Polynomial}

The \emph{content} of a nonzero polynomial $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_0$,
where the $a$’s are integers, is the greatest common divisor of the integers
$a_n, a_{n-1},\dots , a_0$. A primitive polynomial is an element of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with
content 1.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}{Gauss's Lemma}

The product of two primitive polynomials is primitive.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}{Reducibility over $\mathbb{Q}$ Implies Reducibility over $\mathbb{Z}$}

Let $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$. If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, then it is reducible over $\mathbb{Z}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}{Mod $p$ Irreducibility Test}

Let $p$ be a prime and suppose that $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $\textit{deg} f(x) \leq 1$.

Let $\bar{f}(x)$ be the polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ obtained from $f(x)$ by reducing

all the coefficients of $f(x)$ modulo $p$. If $\bar{f}(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and
$\textit{deg} f(x)= \textit{deg} f(x)$ then $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}{Eisenstein's Criterion (1850)}

Let
$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_0 \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$.

If there is a prime $p$ such that $p \nmid a_n,p|a_{n-1},\dots,p|a_0$ and $p^2 \nmid a_0$.
then $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{corollary}{Irreducibility of $p$th Cyclotomic Polynomial}

For any prime $p$, the $p$th cyclotomic polynomial

$\Phi_p(x)=\frac{x^p-1}{x-1}=x^{p-1}+x^{p-2}+\dots+x+1$

is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem} $\langle p(x) \rangle$ is Maximal If and Only If $p(x)$ is Irreducible

Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field and let $p(x) \in \mathbb{F}[x]$. Then $\langle p(x) \rangle$ is a maximal ideal

in $\mathbb{F} [x]$ if and only if $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{F}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}{Unique Factorization in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$}

Every polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ that is not the zero polynomial or a unit
in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ can be written in the form $b_1b_2 \dots b_sp_1(x)p_2(x) \dots p_m(x)$,
where the $b_i$’s are irreducible polynomials of degree 0 and the pl(x)’s
are irreducible polynomials of positive degree. Furthermore, if

$$b_1b_2 \dots b_sp_1(x)p_2(x) \dots p_m(x) = c_1c_2 \dots c_t q_1(x)q_2(x) \dots q_n(x),$$

where the $b_i$’s and $c_i$’s are irreducible polynomials of degree 0 and the
$p_i(x)$’s and $q_i(x)$’s are irreducible polynomials of positive degree, then
$s = t, m = n$, and, after renumbering the $c$’s and $q(x)$’s, we have

$b_i = \pm c_i$ for $i = 1, \dots,s$ and $p_i(x) = \pm q_i(x)$ for $i = 1, \dots , m$.
\end{theorem}
