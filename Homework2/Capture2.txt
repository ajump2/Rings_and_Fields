3. Show that a commutative ring with the cancellation property (under
multiplication) has no zero—divisors.

5. Show that every nonzero element of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a unit or a zero-divisor.

6. Find a nonzero element in a ring that is neither a zero-divisor nor a
unit.

11. Let $d$ be an integer. Prove that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}] = \{a + b\sqrt{d} \,\vert \, a, b \in Z\}$ is an
integral domain. (This exercise is referred to in Chapter 18.)

15. Let $a$ belong to a ring $R$ with unity and suppose that $a^n = 0$ for
some positive integer $n$. (Such an element is called \textit{nilpotent}.) Prove
that $1 - a$ has a multiplicative inverse in $R$. [Hints Consider ($1 - a$)
$(1+a+a^2+\dots+a^{n-1})$.]

16. Show that the nilpotent elements of a commutative ring form a subring.

21. Let $R$ be the ring of real-valued continuous functions on $[-1, 1]$.
Show that $R$ has zero-divisors.

29. (Subfield Test) Let $F$ be a field and let $K$ be a subset of $F$ with at
least two elements. Prove that $K$ is a subfield of $F$ if, for any
$a, b \,(b\neq 0)$ in $K$, $a - b$ and $ab^{-1}$ belong to $K$.

34. Prove that there is no integral domain with exactly six elements. Can
your argument be adapted to show that there is no integral domain

with exactly four elements? What about 15 elements? Use these observations to guess a general result about the number of elements in a
finite integral domain.

56. Find all solutions of $x^2 - x + 2 = 0$ over $Z_3[i]$. (See Example 9.)

61. Describe the smallest subfield of the field of real numbers that con—
tains $\sqrt{2}$. (That is, describe the subfield $K$ with the property that $K$
contains $\sqrt{2}$ and if $F$ is any subfield containing $\sqrt{2}$, then $F$ con—
tains $K$.)

67. Suppose that $D$ is an integral domain and that $\phi$ is a nonconstant
function from $D$ to the nonnegative integers such that $\phi(xy) =
\phi(x)\phi(y)$. If $x$ is a unit in $D$, show that $\phi(x) = 1$.
