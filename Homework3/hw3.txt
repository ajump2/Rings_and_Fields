2. In $\mathbb{Z}_3[x]$, show that the distinct polynomials $x^4 + x$ and $x^2 + x$
determine the same function from $\mathbb{Z}_3$ to $\mathbb{Z}_3$.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|cr}
\hline
x & x^4+x & x^2+x\\
\hline
0 &[x^4+x](0) = 0+0 = 0 & [x^2+x](0) = 0+0 = 0\\
\hline
1 & [x^4+x](1) = 1^4+1 = 2 & [x^2+x](1) = 1^2+1 = 2\\
\hline
2 & [x^4+x](2) = 2^4+2 = 18\mod{3} = 0 & [x^2+x](2) = 2^2+2  = 6\mod{3} = 0\\
\hline
\end{array}\]

3. Show that $x^2 + 3x + 2$ has four zeros in $\mathbb{Z}_6$.
\[\begin{array}{lcc}
 \left[x^2+3 x+2\right](0) = 2\mod{6} = 2 \\
 \left[x^2+3 x+2\right](1) = 6\mod{6} = 0 \\
 \left[x^2+3 x+2\right](2) = 12\mod{6} = 0 \\
 \left[x^2+3 x+2\right](3) = 20\mod{6} = 2 \\
 \left[x^2+3 x+2\right](4) = 30\mod{6} = 0 \\
 \left[x^2+3 x+2\right](5) = 42\mod{6} = 0 \\
\end{array}\]
7. Find two distinct cubic polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ that determine the same
function from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ to $\mathbb{Z}_2$.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
x & x^3+x & x^3+x^2 \\
\hline
0 & 0+0=0 & 0+0=0 \\
\hline
1 & 1^3+1=2\mod{2}=0 & 1^3+1^2=2\mod{2}=0 \\
\hline
\end{array}\]

9. Let $f(x) = 5x^4 + 3x^3 + 1$ and $g(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1$ in $\mathbb{Z}_7[x]$.
Determine the quotient and remainder upon dividing $f(x)$ by $g(x)$.
\[
\begin{array}{m{3.5em}ccccccccc}
&    &    &    &    &    &    &4x^2&+3x&+6\\
\cline{3-10}
\multicolumn{2}{l}{3x^2+2x+1)}\hspace{-1.1em}
     &    &    &    &+5x^4&+3x^3&    &  &+1  \\
&    &    &    &    &+5x^4&+x^3&+4x^2&  &  \\
\cline{5-8}
&    &    &    &    &    &+2x^3&+3x^2&  &+1\\
&    &    &    &    &    &+2x^3&+6x^2&+3x&  \\
\cline{7-9}
&    &    &    &    &    &     &+4x^2&+4x&+1\\
&    &    &    &    &    &     &+4x^2&+5x&+6\\
\cline{8-10}
&    &    &    &    &    &     &     &+6x&+2\\
\end{array}
\]

which implies that the quotient of $f(x)/g(x)$ is $4x^2+3x+6$ and the remainder is $6x+2$.

I also learned about the polynom package, although it won't reduce polynomials over finite fields.

$$\polylongdiv{5x^4 + 3x^3 + 1}{3x^2 + 2x + 1}$$

\circled{12.} If the rings $R$ and $S$ are isomorphic, show that $R[x]$ and $S[x]$ are
isomorphic.\\

Let $\phi$ be an isomorphism from $R$ to $S$, and $\sigma$ be a homomorphism from $R[x]$ to $S[x]$. We know that $\ker{\phi}=\{0\}$, and we want to show that $\ker{\sigma}=\{0\}$.
First of all, we should note that all coefficients of $a\in R$ of $R[x]$ are equivalent to $\phi{(a)}\in S[x]$. We then define $\sigma$ as the polynomial extension of $\phi$, where a polynomial $f(x)=a_nx^n+\dots+a_0$ in $R[x]$ is mapped by $\sigma$ to $\sigma(f(x))=\phi(a_n)x^n+\dots+\phi(a_0)$. Because $\phi$ is an isomorphism, we know that $\phi^{-1}$ exists. Now we consider $\phi^{-1}(\phi(a_n))x^n+\dots+\phi^{-1}(\phi(a_0))=\sigma^{-1}(\sigma(f(x)))$, which shows that $\sigma^{-1}$ exists. As a result of $\phi$ being onto and $\ker{\phi}={0}$, these attributes are immediately inherited by $\sigma$. \textbf{Note:} I'm pretty sure I need to show this, and can't immediately assume it.\newline

15. Show that the polynomial $2x + 1$ in $\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$ has a multiplicative inverse in $\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$.\\

$2x+1$ is its own inverse in $\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$, observe that $(2x+1)^2=4x^2+4x+1\mod{4}=1$.\newline

20. Prove that the ideal $\langle x \rangle$ in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is maximal.\\

By Theorem 14.4, we know that $\mathbb{Q}[x]/\langle x \rangle$ is a field if and only if $\langle x \rangle$ is maximal. We can see that $\mathbb{Q}[x]/\langle x \rangle=\mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{Q}$ is a field. This immediately implies that $\langle x \rangle$ is maximal.\newline

24. Let $\mathbb{F}$ be an infinite field and let $f(x), g(x) \in \mathbb{F} [x]$. If $f(a) = g(a)$ for
infinitely many elements $a$ of $\mathbb{F}$, show that $f(x) = g(x)$.\\

By the Remainder Theorem, we know that $f(x)/(x-a)=f(a)$, or $f(x)=f(a)(x-a)$. However, because $f(a)=g(a)$, we can assert that $f(x)=g(a)(x-a)$. Likewise, we know that $g(x)=g(a)(x-a)$ by the remainder theorem, which implies that $f(x)=g(x)$.\newline

38. (Wilsonâ€™s Theorem) For every integer $n > 1$, prove that $(n - 1)! \mod{n} = n - 1$ if and only if $n$ is prime.\\

We can note that our operation is occurring in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, which has characteristic $p$.\newline

46. Prove that $\mathbb{Q}[x]/\langle x^2 - 2 \rangle$ is ring-isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b\sqrt{2} \ \vert \ a, b \in \mathbb{Q}\}$.\\

Let $\gamma$ be a mapping from $\mathbb{Q}[x]/\langle x^2 - 2 \rangle$ to $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]$
